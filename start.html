                                    <p>So you’ve decided to organise PyCon. Quite a task!</p>
                                    <p>You should start planning the conference at least six months prior to the date. (For larger conference, the planning might start a year in advance.) You’ll be keeping track of a lot of moving parts.</p>  
                                    <p>You must have a million questions on your mind. Where do you start? How do you find the right speakers to invite? Which venue will best suit your needs?</p>
                                    <p>Take it easy.</p>
                                    <p>The truth is, even though organising a conference is a demanding endeavour, you’re not the first one to face it. There’s no need to reinvent the wheel. It’s all about following a few specific steps.</p>
                                    <p> We’ve prepared this quick step-by-step guide on how to organise a PyCon. It’ll walk you through the main steps involved and link you over to valuable tools and articles that will make your job a lot easier. 
                                        The steps aren’t strictly chronological---you may well start contacting potential speakers before you’ve secured a venue---but they give you a rough idea of what to focus on first. Ready to start?</p></p>
                                    
                                <h3 class="block-title">Step 1: Decide on a Theme</h3>
                                    <p>Every great conference needs a theme.</p>
                                    <p>The best themes are catchy, relatable, and trigger an emotional response. You want the conference to inspire and stimulate conversation. Your theme has to enable that.</p> 
                                    <p>The theme is more than just a rallying cry for all participants; it will also guide your branding and promotion, from designing a logo to coming up with social media hashtags to printing your posters, brochures, and other collateral.</p>

                                <p>You’re trying to get them to help you in the limited time they’ve got available for you, so you need to facilitate that to get the best out of it. </p>
                                <p>Provide clear roles and responsibilities of each member so they know who makes what decision and it prevents conflicts too.</p>
                                <p>Make it clear at the beginning what decisions committee members aren’t responsible for, such as helping speakers with their travel arrangements or accommodation for speakers. 
                                    Set priorities according to the capabilities of the team. If there is sufficient volunteers to sort out logistics, then go ahead and make it happen. </p>
                                <p>It’s important that you make your team feel confident and keep them informed of how things are progressing.
                                    Giving committee members a view of the bigger picture is important. Give them a top-level summary of how the conference fits in strategically with other activities we do. 
                                    Include a summary of conference costs and income, to make them aware of financial implications and budgetary restrictions. </p>

                                    <p>You need to know where your money is being earned and spent.</p>

                                    <li>Venue</li>

                                    <p>Preparing a budget with realistic estimates will also come in handy when searching for venues and negotiating contracts.</p>

                                    <p>You’ll want to go out looking for sponsors or arrange fundraisers. 
                                        The key thing to keep in mind is that the sponsors and their values should align with the theme of your conference. 
                                        (A company using JS will not be interested to sponsor Python related event)</p>
                                    <p>Start by finding sponsors that fund similar events or are generally associated with your conference’s main themes.</p>
                                    <p>Decide how much say the sponsors should have in how the conference is run. Where do you want their logo to be in exchange for their sponsorship? 
                                        Be creative with the type of sponsorship. Some sponsors will be interested to sponsor beer for party or lanyards for delegates.</p>
                                    <p>Some sponsors will be interested to bring their own speakers. We will advise you to be vigilant and if you allow them to, screen through their content, 
                                        ask for the names of the speakers they’re assigning and the topic they’re covering. Do some research about the speakers and make sure that the topic reconciled with the theme.</p>
                                    <p>Remember: It’s a fine balance between getting funded and sacrificing the integrity of your conference. You’re the judge of where to draw that line.</p>

                                    <h3 class="block-title">Step 5: Settle on a date </h3>  
                                    <p>Now it’s time to decide when your conference will take place. As discussed, that date should be anywhere from six months to a year ahead. 
                                        The more number of attendees, the earlier you need to prepare. The best solution will be to book one year in advance as popular venues are usually booked at least one year in advance. </p>
                                    <p>Bangkok is a popular venue for not only local conferences but also international conferences due to it’s well-situated geographic location.  </p>
                                    <p>PyCon AU did a great job by preparing more than a year in advance and revealing next year’s date and venue on the last day of their conference. If you are able to do so, that will be perfect. </p>
                                    <p>You also need to decide how long the conference will last. Whether it is going to be single track or multiple tracks. PyCon Thailand started off with 3 tracks, 2-days conference and several workshops included. 
                                        Work within the ability of work team. Be realistic. Being too ambitious is just going to tire the entire team out. Also make sure that it will be feasible for the venue. </p>
                                    <br/>
                                    <p>Here are some great rules of thumb to keep in mind:</p>
                                    
                                    <h6 id="check-on-major-events-and-public-holidays">Check on major events and public holidays</h6>
                                    <p>Pick a date that doesn’t conflict with other major events like festivals. City-wide events make booking flights more expensive and generally hinder transportation to and from the conference. 
                                        Besides, you don’t want your conference to compete for attention with big events. Check for on your local calendar to ensure that it is not a long weekend public holiday as people tend to go on family vacation during that period. </p>

                                    <p>Avoid summer and winter holiday periods when people tend to go on vacation. </p>
                                    <p>In Thailand, avoid Songkran, Loy Krathong, Election dates, Christmas and New Year’s day. </p>
                                    <p>It’s best to aim for a date between the middle of March and end of June or from early September to late November.</p>
                                    
                                    <h6 id="check-the-school-calendar">Check the school calendar</h6>
                                    <p>If students are also one of your target market, check on the local universities to ensure that they’re not having their exams or graduation during the dates. </p>
                                    <p>Our current choice is in June as most universities are on summer break and we do not clash with other PyCons held around Asia Pacific. </p>

                                    <p>You don’t want to clash the dates among your neighbouring fellow organisers.
                                    Contact the PyCon APAC organisers if you are unsure of their dates. </p>
                                    <h6 id="weekdays-or-weekends-">Weekdays or weekends?</h6>
                                    <p>We would suggest weekends as many python coders are also hobbyists and might not be able to take their days off during the week. Or end of the week, so that traveling attendees get the chance to stay behind and sightsee during their time off. 
                                        The best days could possibly be Friday and Saturday or Saturday and Sunday depending on your main group of attendees.</p>
                                    <p>Setting a date will give you a fixed point to count back from to better plan your preparations and also helps determine if your keynote speakers will be available during that period.</p>

                                    <h3 class="block-title">Step 6: Book the venue </h3> 
                                    <p>Once you know the date, you can start looking for available venues that match your requirements.
                                    For PyCon Thailand, It is not easy to handle venues especially when we handle multiple tracks. We need to ensure that every room fits in the estimated capacity of attendees and that the walking  </p>
                                    <p>In general, venues might fall into three categories:</p>
                                        <p><strong>University campuses:</strong> These are best suited for smaller, academic events and are relatively cheap to hire.</p>
                                        <p><strong>Hotels:</strong> These typically have dedicated conference facilities and own catering. They’re the best all-in-one choice since they offer both accommodation and conference space. They also tend to be the most expensive option.</p>
                                        <p><strong>Independent venues:</strong> This category includes all other types of venues that can host conferences. Many of these specialise in specific types of events.</p>
                                        <p>But the cost of the venue is just one part of the puzzle. Here are a few other factors to consider when looking for the right venue:</p>
                                    
                                    <h6 id="size-">Size:</h6>
                                        <p>Booking a too-small venue where everybody has to squeeze into a tiny room is clearly a bad idea. Similarly, 
                                        securing a giant venue for a relatively modest crowd will not only hurt your wallet but also make the conference feel empty and poorly attended.
                                        You can try to calculate the <a href="https://www.confpeople.co.uk/free-venue-finding/room-capacity-calculator" target="_blank">room capacity</a></p>
                                        <p>If you’re running a 2 day conference, note that not everyone attend the entire conference. Some of them will wander off to get their office work done in a corner or arrive only on time to attend their favourite talks. Adding a little 10-15% more attendees on your keynote talks is actually feasible. </p>
                                            
                                    <h6 id="location-">Location:</h6>
                                        <p>Find location that are easily accessible by public transportation. Some feedback we got over the past reviewed that attendees prefer location where it’s not too secluded. And if you’re picking a more secluded place, make sure that you provide a solution for attendees who does not have their private transport. It will be perfect if the venue has calming, picturesque surroundings to help people relax and at the same time accessible via public transportation though it is not easy to find such location.</p>
                                    
                                    <h6 id="atmosphere-">Atmosphere:</h6>
                                        <p>It’s crucial that the vibe of the venue suits your target audience and theme. You don’t want to host a business conference inside a giant gym, for instance.</p>
                                                    
                                    <h6 id="facilities-">Facilities:</h6>
                                        <p>Does the venue have the proper layout and the right conference room styles for your needs? Does it have the necessary facilities like e.g. smaller rooms for breakout sessions?</p>
                                        <p>Conferences like PyCon require several equipment like headsets for each track (speakers might be live coding), podium to place laptops, wireless mics for session leads, HDMI for video recording, etc to be taken into consideration.</p>
                                        
                                    <h6 id="accommodation-">Accommodation:</h6>
                                        <p>Does the venue provide accommodation or are there hotels nearby?</p>
                                                    
                                    <h6 id="catering-">Catering:</h6>
                                        <p>Is catering included or can external catering companies easily get to and work inside the venue? If not, are there suitable restaurants and cafes in the area? (Keep in mind any special dietary requirements: vegan, kosher, nut-free, etc.)</p>
                                                    
                                    <h6 id="transportation-">Transportation:</h6>
                                        <p>How easy is it for participants to travel to the venue by public transport? Are there enough parking spots for those who drive?</p>
                                    
                                    <h6 id="technical-aspects-">Technical aspects:</h6>
                                        <p>Does the venue have the right IT, audio, and video equipment? You’ll need projection screens, microphones, plenty of charging spots for participants, and---of course---solid WiFi access.</p>
                                        <p>When negotiating with potential venues, try to arrange for early access to the place so that you can do a “dry run” or a walkthrough with your team prior to the conference. You should be able to ensure that every detail is in place before the big day.</p>

                                     <p>Keep a list of topics on hand that you know your local market will be interested in from a market survey or feedback you receive in the previous years.</p>
                                     <p>PyCon Thailand 2019 used stickers with different subject topics for delegates to choose what interest them and to stick onto their badges. At the end of the event, we’ve collected the leftover stickers and were able to calculate the topics that interest the delegates most. </p>

                                     <p>But don’t throw away that list just yet! You want to have plenty of backup speakers in case some of your first-priority ones cancel. You should always have a Plan B.</p>
                                     <p>Don’t forget that you’re representing a specific demographic location. Make sure that you have a substantial percentage of local speakers too. You’ll save on transportation and lend an air of authenticity to the conference.</p>

                                        <p>Now that the key elements are in place, it’s time to shape them into a detailed agenda. Ideally, you want your agenda to be in place at least four months before the conference starts.</p>
                                        <p>Remember that the conference’s main objective is to inspire people and expand their horizons. You can’t do that without an understanding of your attendees.</p>
                                        <p>Try to get inside the mind of a typical attendee and answer a few key questions: What are their expectations? What knowledge do they already have and what would they like to learn more about? What types of sessions <em>(presentations, workshops, etc.)</em> could best help them absorb the ideas discussed?</p>
                                        <p>Set a time limit to each talk ranging from 20-30 mins, lightning talks 5-10mins and workshops 3-4 hours.</p>
                                        <p>Armed with this information, you can begin drafting an agenda. 
                                        A top-level conference agenda might look something like this:</p>
