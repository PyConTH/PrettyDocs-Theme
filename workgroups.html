                                            Starting from PyConTH 2019, PyConTH set up workgroups to help implement the
                                            organising tasks without losing information and knowledge every time new
                                            organisers steps up.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Workgroups and lead organiser will update, coordinate and plan activities on
                                            a regular basis. While every workgroup will be responsible for its own
                                            coordination and establish a workflow that best fits its needs, we expect
                                            all workgroups to integrate and interact with other workgroups to create a
                                            productive work environment.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            To simplify and speed up the workgroup setup, we will create a set of
                                            workgroup guidelines which aim at collecting the institutional knowledge
                                            gathered over the years.
                                        </p>

                                            The Python Thailand Society collects and reviews the applications to each
                                            workgroup. The PTS core team will decide and create set of workgroup members
                                            with (workgroup internal) voting rights and then have the workgroup chair
                                            appoint additional (non-voting) members as necessary.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Workgroups will be confirmed/reestablished by core team&#39;s vote every
                                            year, this allows non-voting members to become voting members in the
                                            following year.

                                            With full distribution, we would require about 20 people. Some jobs, like
                                            the website engineer, the sponsor lead and the Marketing lead require quite
                                            a bit of time, while others are quite limited in scope. Certain leader
                                            positions could be share by 2 people if the workload is heavier.

                                                    Think carefully about booking a speaker whose content might cause
                                                    division among your audience Don’t book anybody who you wouldn’t be

                                                Looking internally is a great way to stretch your budget further, retain
                                                more control over the speech’s message, and establish your organisation
                                                as the home of thought leaders – you may even unearth hidden talent in
                                                your ranks.

                                                This can be an especially effective route to take when your speaker
                                                needs to be highly knowledgeable about the intricacies of your industry,
                                                understand the nuances of your corporate culture or have a background
                                                specific to your organisation.

                                                It’s also a great opportunity to reward employees with time in the
                                                spotlight and integrate delegate-led content into your conference. And
                                                if your in-house candidate lacks confidence or public speaking
                                                experience, it’s easy to find training.

                                                The technology uses in PyCon is as integral to success as the choice of
                                                entertainment or communications strategy. Even relatively modern
                                                advances like e-ticketing, digital surveys and event apps aren’t just
                                                expected by delegates, they’re vital to ensuring an event runs smoothly.
                                                However, in this brave new world of conferencing, even providing
                                                important functionality soon won’t be enough, as organisers begin to
                                                fully understand the significance of delegate engagement.

                                            <p>
                                                For example, once upon a time the majority of delegates were happy
                                                carrying around an actual event programme. Yet, as soon as it was
                                                possible, they wanted digital versions instead. Now, as well as
                                                receiving the information upfront they want to be notified just before a
                                                speaker takes to the stage. Giving them enough time to grab a drink and
                                                find a spot in the crowd. putting a timer on screen before next talk.

                                                As well as turning a blind eye to any tech that can’t provide what they
                                                need when they need it, conference attendees have zero use for anything
                                                crowbarred into their experience. VR might still be “on trend”, but if
                                                it doesn’t add value to the experience, delegates simply won’t engage
                                                with it.

                                                Many conferences are introducing AI-chatbots to help attendees navigate
                                                events without tying up staff, but chatbots also serve another purpose.
                                                By simply examining the questions delegates ask, you can learn which
                                                elements of your conference are causing confusion.

                                                Obviously, not everything you learn is going to feel important, but the
                                                less time delegates spend worrying about little details, the more
                                                attention they can pay to your messaging.

                                                and whistles, your conference is only successful if you actually
