                                        <p>Starting from PyConTH 2019, PyConTH set up workgroups to help implement the organising tasks without losing information and knowledge every time new organisers steps up. </p>
                                        <p>Workgroups and lead organiser will update, coordinate and plan activities on a regular basis. While every workgroup will be responsible for its own coordination and establish a workflow that best fits its needs, 
                                            we expect all workgroups to integrate and interact with other workgroups to create a productive work environment.</p>
                                        <p>To simplify and speed up the workgroup setup, we will create a set of workgroup guidelines which aim at collecting the institutional knowledge gathered over the years.</p>   
                                        <h6 id="transparency">Transparency</h6>
                                        <p>The Python Thailand Society collects and reviews the applications to each workgroup. The PTS core team will decide and create set of workgroup members with (workgroup internal) voting rights and then have the workgroup chair appoint additional (non-voting) members as necessary.</p>
                                        <p>Workgroups will be confirmed/reestablished by core team&#39;s vote every year, this allows non-voting members to become voting members in the following year.</p>

                                    <p>These are the roles visualised in the organisation of PyConTH. It is quite possible for one person to have several roles, but the more distributed the jobs get, the easier it will be to get each one done well.</p>
                                    <p>With full distribution, we would require about 20 people. Some jobs, like the website engineer, the sponsor lead and the Marketing lead require quite a bit of time, while others are quite limited in scope. Certain leader positions could be share by 2 people if the workload is heavier.</p>

                                        <p>As most of the people in a conference organizing committee aren’t being paid, and have busy full-time jobs, it’s important the chair can inspire them from the very top. So, the chair should be able to clearly define goals, and be able to highlight that everyone has a stake in the success of a conference.</p>
                                        <p>Planning a conference can make even seasoned events professionals feel jaded or overwhelmed. But to win delegate attention today, you’ve got to do more than just tick off your standard checklist.</p>
                                        <p>Successful events leave nothing to chance, and no decision, however small, should be made with consideration. Every aspect of your conference is connected and should be aligned to better delight delegates and satisfy stakeholders.</p>
                                        
                                     
                                     <h5 id="1-understanding-your-goals">1. Understanding Your Goals</h5>
                                        <ul>
                                        <li>list your goals to keep yourself on track
                                        It is a truth universally acknowledged that no organisation hosts a conference without a hidden (or sometimes not-so hidden) agenda. Delivering the desired results is much easier if you understand why vast amounts of time, effort and money are being invested in the event. In fact, one of the greatest tools for organising a successful conference is simply having a concrete and quantifiable answer to one very simple question:</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <p><em>What does a successful conference look like to you?</em></p>
                                        <ol>
                                        <li>How Will You Measure Your Success?</li>
                                        <li>create KPIs to measure your success</li>
                                        </ol>
                                        <p>When deciding your conference goals, you should also take time to plan how you’ll measure your achievements. Not only will this help you determine if your goals are viable, it’ll also make sure you’re aware of any technology or practices that need to be implemented – for example, a platform to deliver delegate surveys efficiently.</p>
                                        <p>Obviously, all conferences are different. While yours might be a tangle of seemingly contradictory goals, you have to decide what is the ultimate aim to go for </p>
                                        <p>Identifying the driving force behind your conference and using it to inform your decision-making will significantly simplify the planning process. You can make sure you’re always choosing a route that helps you achieve your goals by just asking yourself:</p>

                                        <p>No matter who’s booked to speak or what entertainment is planned, the real superstars of your conference are your attendees. They’re the beating heart of your event and vital to your success.</p>
                                        <p>So, every element of your conference needs to be viewed through the lens of meeting their needs and delivering value (as well as helping you achieve your goals), from the catering and entertainment, to the communications strategy and choice of venue.</p>
                                        <p>Of course, delivering this is much easier if you actually know who your delegates are and what they want from a conference. The best way to gain this insight is a tried and tested market research methodology – defining buyer, or in this case attendees, personas.</p>
                                        <h4 id="persona-marketing">Persona Marketing</h4>
                                        <p>If you’re not already familiar with persona marketing, it involves creating representations of the core delegates that make up your audience, in order to better understand their needs and motivations. This can be done in four basic steps:</p>
                                        <p>Segment your audience into typical groups of attendees. These could be based upon anything from location, age, job role, motivation for engagement or any combination that works for your conference.</p>
                                        <p>For each segment, collect a set of data that provides a clear idea of the average delegate. You should draw from a wide range of personal, consumer and vocational information – some of which may come from a 3rd-party.</p>
                                        <p>Using your data sets, create a well-rounded, semi-fictional character to represent each of your personas. This should make it easier to step into their shoes and see your event through their eyes, providing insight into how you can deliver engaging and delightful conference experiences.</p>
                                        <p>When planning your event, always make sure you’re making delegate-centred decisions by constantly asking yourself: How will this conference element provide value for this delegate persona?</p>
                                        <p>Your finished delegate personas might read somewhat like the following examples, although you should note that these are very simple and the more detail you include, the more insight you’ll discover. </p>
                                        <p>Judging from PyCon Thailand’s delegates, the delegated personas are as below:</p>
                                    </br>

                                        <p><strong>Employee Emmy</strong></p>
                                        <p>Employee Emmy is 20-30, engaged and planning to get married soon, works as a backend developer in an international organisation. They&#39;re the household’s secondary earner and their monthly treat is a fancy meal or night out with friends.</p>
                                        <p>Emmy takes pride in their job, works hard and embraces any training opportunities available, although they’re generally uninterested in wider company performance. Enjoys having something to aim for and appreciates how their organisation rewards their hard work.</p>

                                        <p><em>Designing the Delegate Journey</em></p>
                                        <p>Every interaction a delegate has that involves your conference should contribute to moving them closer to taking an action needed for you to achieve your goals – from the first point of contact to the very end of the event lifecycle, and every sight, sound and social interaction in-between.</p>
                                        <p>Your audience should be able to move seamlessly through the delegate journey and so every touchpoint needs to do three things:</p>
                                        <ul>
                                        <li>Motivate the delegate to take an action that moves you closer to your goals</li>
                                        <li>Provide an obvious way forward along the delegate journey</li>
                                        <li>Feel natural and make sense – you should never make delegates feel manipulated</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <p>When planning you should be able to plot a clear path from the beginning of the delegate journey to the end. If any touchpoints don’t meet the requirements, it’s an opportunity to create new experiences that successfully move delegates along.  </p>
                                        <p><em>Results</em></p>
                                        <p>Creating an enjoyable conference experience is obviously extremely important, but it’s vital you keep in mind that the event is just means to an end – ultimately, success is only judged on whether you achieve your goals.</p>
                                        <p>Simply comparing event data to your goals will provide a basic understanding of your achievements. However, this stage of the conference lifecycle is an opportunity to gain in-depth insight into how your event (and you, as a conference organiser) performed. Don’t be scared to dive deeper into your data to find answers.</p>
                                        
                                     
                                     <h5 id="3-managing-your-team">3. Managing your team</h5>
                                        <p>As the conference chair, you join an organization and sometimes the organizing committee has already been appointed. So it’s important that you learn how to work with them.</p>
                                        <p>Handling a team where everyone has to work alongside the range of expertise and opinions of committee members, it doesn’t always run smoothly…</p>
                                        <p>Everything has a knock-on effect when you’re organizing an event. When there isn’t a clear structure in terms of who’s responsible for making what decision, then as an event team we’re not quite sure which direction to go. It all gets a bit messy and delays happen, and then you don’t hit your delegate numbers and conflicts occur too.</p>
                                        <p>Go through these train of questions to ask your team member:</p>
                                        <p>&quot;What can I do to help you?&quot; </p>
                                        <p>&quot;What’s the best way for us to communicate and work with you?&quot; </p>
                                        <p>&quot;What do you need from us so you can make the decisions we need you to make?&quot;</p>
                                        <p>Providing them with what they need, so they can come back to you with what you need is really important.</p>
                                        <p>Getting recognition for your work can be challenging when you’re working with people outside the event planning world who often think organising an event is an easy task. So it’s important that you make them feel confident about your ability to deliver and keep them informed of how things are progressing.
                                        Giving committee members a view of the bigger picture is important.</p>
                                        <p>As part of the onboarding process, we give them a top-level summary of how the conference fits in strategically with other activities we do. We also include a summary of conference costs and income, to make them aware of financial implications and budgetary restrictions. 
                                        Then the entire team are clear on where we’re at.</p>
                                        <p><em>Avoiding assumptions</em></p>
                                        <p>Even if you have to state the obvious, do state it. Because although there are things that for us are standard practice and we think everyone knows this, they don’t. That’s not what they do for a living. So never make assumptions, because sometimes it’s not obvious to them and you realise when it’s too late.“</p>
                                        <p>Conduct induction meeting with committee members and follow up with information in writing so they can read it and they can refer back to it. And when we have a conversation with someone over the phone or in person, we follow up with an email to summarise what we discussed so everyone is on the same page.</p>
                                        
                                     
                                     <h5 id="4-reflection">4. Reflection</h5>
                                        <p>Thankfully, collecting and analysing data no longer requires manually wading through spreadsheets, tally charts, and budgets, so discovering actionable insight into your event now takes far less time and effort.</p>
                                        <p>This can give you more time and energy to reflect meaningfully on the results. Your own observations and data complemented with the strategic use of readily available tools will empower you to answer questions like:</p>
                                        <p>What messages resonated most?
                                        What did we do successfully?
                                        What can be improved?</p>
                                        <p>Get feedback from your staff, your team, your sponsors.</p>
                                        <p>Don’t simply link to your survey in your post-event email. Embed your first question in the survey itself.</p>
                                        <p>A SurveyMonkey study found a 22% increase in survey opens when the survey’s first question was right in the email. And not only are people more likely to open a survey that teases the first question, they’re also 20% more likely to finish the entire survey.</p>

                                        <p>The final stage of the conference lifecycle brings you full circle, as you begin to set resolutions for next year. Remember, it’s never too early to start doing the necessary groundwork for your next event by thinking about:</p>
                                        <ul>
                                        <li>Five things we are going to do again and how to improve them</li>
                                        <li>Conference elements that actively helped us achieve our goals</li>
                                        <li>Five things we are not going to do again and what we can do instead</li>
                                        <li>Conference elements that actively prevented us achieving our goals</li>
                                        </ul>

                                        <p>To ensure consistency and that next conference leader has a strong grasp of the organising structure and responsibilities, the conference leader should hold its position for a minimum of 2 years and a maximum of not more than 4 years. Should the conference lead decides to step down in less than 2 years due to unforeseen circumstances, the committee members should submit the names of the candidates before the end of the conference and vote for the next conference lead. </p>

                                    <p>This is the kind of thinking that delivers copy-and-paste conferences delegates have come to dread. Instead, your theme should set the tone for the entire event and needs to:</p>
                                    <h6 id="reflect-your-goals">Reflect Your Goals</h6>
                                    <p>Your theme informs the look and feel of your entire conference, so it’s likely to be what delegates remember best when they leave. Therefore, it’s vital it communicates the purpose of your event at first glance and it should always be aligned with your branding.</p>
                                    <p>Themes work best when you keep them simple, they’re easy to understand and can be applied to every touchpoint in the event lifecycle.</p>
                                    <h6 id="engage-your-delegates">Engage Your Delegates</h6>
                                    <p>The last thing you want is attendees switching off before they’ve really heard your message, so your theme needs to grab delegates’ attention before they even step foot in the venue. You should avoid selecting anything that might be unappealing to any of your delegate personas or that excludes anybody – regardless of gender, sexuality, age, race, religion or any disabilities.</p>
                                    <h6 id="immerse-attendees-in-the-experience">Immerse Attendees in the Experience</h6>
                                    <p>Deliver an experience that makes delegates feel they’re part of something a world away from the humdrum of the 9-5 by immersing them in your theme. Incorporate it into every aspect of your event, from comms to catering, as well as every nook and cranny of your venue – for example, provide opportunities for attendees to create and share social media content, like photobooths or event geofilters.</p>
                                    <h6 id="setting-up-your-venue">Setting Up Your Venue</h6>
                                    <p>Choosing a venue that reflects your brand and helps set the tone for your conference is pretty much “Events 101” – but what does the way you lay out your event say about you?</p>
                                    <p>As an industry we still seem determined to herd delegates around a stage, despite breaking away from having a traditionally rigid divide between audience and speakers. Why not literally set yourself up as innovative, bold and unique by choose a venue with enough space to challenge that conference convention?</p>
                                    <h6 id="festivalisation">Festivalisation</h6>
                                    <p>In short, if your delegates switch off, they won’t hear your message. That’s why today’s conferences borrow heavily from the festival experience, with as much emphasis on entertainment as education.</p>
                                    <p>It’s now not uncommon for live music and stand-up to be booked alongside keynote speeches or to see traditional exhibition stands replaced with tech showcases and interactive experiences.</p>
                                    <p>You may already be following in the footsteps of events like SXSW, by integrating festivalisation into your conference, but, for any occasion, a good rule of thumb is to identify which elements of your event may cause delegates to drift into a daydream.</p>

                                                    <p>Event communications have a vital role in this engagement and perform many different functions, from simply delivering event details to creating serious hype for the big day. But one of the most underappreciated jobs is reasserting key messaging – before and after your conference.</p>
                                                    <p>The lead up to your conference is the perfect chance to create buzz and capitalise on delegate’s inherent FOMO (fear of missing out) with sneak peaks into your event, a slow drip-feed of details and content from previous years.</p>
                                                    <p>Your messaging should focus on reasons delegates will benefit from attending, instead of aligning directly with your goals.</p>
                                                    <p>In the weeks following your conference you should celebrate the event by sharing plenty of photos and videos, as well as encouraging delegates to do the same – as the experience is fresh in the memory, it’s also the best time to collect feedback. Make sure you check in with your audience, reminding them of why they were there and subtly reasserting key messages.</p>
                                                    <h6 id="the-importance-of-channel-surfing">The Importance of Channel Surfing</h6>
                                                    <p>Any communications professional knows that how you say something is just as important as what you’re saying. Every channel empowers you to talk to delegates differently, so understanding and identifying which are right for your event is vital to your success.</p>
                                                    <p>Is a picture perfect or do you actually need 1000 words? Is sliding into delegates’ DMs a slip up or is their inbox never out of reach? Do they need every little detail or is communication on a need-to-know basis?</p>
                                                    <p>Don’t be afraid to think outside the box in your pursuit of spectacular results. A “public” Facebook Live video can stir up FOMO in even the most anti-social media audience, while a beautifully designed invitation in the post can easily strike a chord with digital natives.</p>
                                                    <p>In general:
                                                    Instagram - Great photo or attractive post with minimal caption. 
                                                    Twitter - Catchy phrase, attention seeking photo.
                                                    FB - brief info, live video, live chat, etc,</p>

                                                    <ul>
                                                    <li>See them speak and have a conversation with them in person before you decide</li>
                                                    <li>Make sure they’re willing to interact with delegates and agree what this involves</li>
                                                    <li>Get a complete breakdown of their fees, and be realistic about any budgetary issues</li>
                                                    <li>Think carefully about booking a speaker whose content might cause division among your audience
                                                    Don’t book anybody who you wouldn’t be happy to choose as the public face of your brand</li>
                                                    </ul>
                                                    <p>Looking internally is a great way to stretch your budget further, retain more control over the speech’s message, and establish your organisation as the home of thought leaders – you may even unearth hidden talent in your ranks.</p>
                                                    <p>This can be an especially effective route to take when your speaker needs to be highly knowledgeable about the intricacies of your industry, understand the nuances of your corporate culture or have a background specific to your organisation.</p>
                                                    <p>It’s also a great opportunity to reward employees with time in the spotlight and integrate delegate-led content into your conference. And if your in-house candidate lacks confidence or public speaking experience, it’s easy to find training.</p>

                                                        <p>The technology uses  in PyCon is as integral to success as the choice of entertainment or communications strategy. Even relatively modern advances like e-ticketing, digital surveys and event apps aren’t just expected by delegates, they’re vital to ensuring an event runs smoothly. However, in this brave new world of conferencing, even providing important functionality soon won’t be enough, as organisers begin to fully understand the significance of delegate engagement.</p>
                                                        <p>For example, once upon a time the majority of delegates were happy carrying around an actual event programme. Yet, as soon as it was possible, they wanted digital versions instead. Now, as well as receiving the information upfront they want to be notified just before a speaker takes to the stage. Giving them enough time to grab a drink and find a spot in the crowd.
                                                        putting a timer on screen before next talk. </p>
                                                        <p>As well as turning a blind eye to any tech that can’t provide what they need when they need it, conference attendees have zero use for anything crowbarred into their experience. VR might still be “on trend”, but if it doesn’t add value to the experience, delegates simply won’t engage with it.</p>

                                                        <p>Many conferences are introducing AI-chatbots to help attendees navigate events without tying up staff, but chatbots also serve another purpose. By simply examining the questions delegates ask, you can learn which elements of your conference are causing confusion.</p>
                                                        <p>Obviously, not everything you learn is going to feel important, but the less time delegates spend worrying about little details, the more attention they can pay to your messaging. </p>
                                                        <p>Although a lot of time and effort is dedicated to arranging the bells and whistles,  your conference is only successful if you actually influence delegates. The key is determining exactly what you want that influence to be and using these trends to make that happen. </p>
