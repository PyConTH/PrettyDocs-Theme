                                        <p>Starting from PyConTH 2019, PyConTH set up workgroups to help implement the organising tasks without losing information and knowledge every time new organisers steps up. </p>
                                        <p>Workgroups and lead organiser will update, coordinate and plan activities on a regular basis. While every workgroup will be responsible for its own coordination and establish a workflow that best fits its needs, 
                                            we expect all workgroups to integrate and interact with other workgroups to create a productive work environment.</p>
                                        <p>To simplify and speed up the workgroup setup, we will create a set of workgroup guidelines which aim at collecting the institutional knowledge gathered over the years.</p>   
                                        <h6 id="transparency">Transparency</h6>
                                        <p>The Python Thailand Society collects and reviews the applications to each workgroup. The PTS core team will decide and create set of workgroup members with (workgroup internal) voting rights and then have the workgroup chair appoint additional (non-voting) members as necessary.</p>
                                        <p>Workgroups will be confirmed/reestablished by core team&#39;s vote every year, this allows non-voting members to become voting members in the following year.</p>

                                    <p>These are the roles visualised in the organisation of PyConTH. It is quite possible for one person to have several roles, but the more distributed the jobs get, the easier it will be to get each one done well.</p>
                                    <p>With full distribution, we would require about 20 people. Some jobs, like the website engineer, the sponsor lead and the Marketing lead require quite a bit of time, while others are quite limited in scope. Certain leader positions could be share by 2 people if the workload is heavier.</p>

                                    <p>This is the kind of thinking that delivers copy-and-paste conferences delegates have come to dread. Instead, your theme should set the tone for the entire event and needs to:</p>
                                    <h6 id="reflect-your-goals">Reflect Your Goals</h6>
                                    <p>Your theme informs the look and feel of your entire conference, so it’s likely to be what delegates remember best when they leave. Therefore, it’s vital it communicates the purpose of your event at first glance and it should always be aligned with your branding.</p>
                                    <p>Themes work best when you keep them simple, they’re easy to understand and can be applied to every touchpoint in the event lifecycle.</p>
                                    <h6 id="engage-your-delegates">Engage Your Delegates</h6>
                                    <p>The last thing you want is attendees switching off before they’ve really heard your message, so your theme needs to grab delegates’ attention before they even step foot in the venue. You should avoid selecting anything that might be unappealing to any of your delegate personas or that excludes anybody – regardless of gender, sexuality, age, race, religion or any disabilities.</p>
                                    <h6 id="immerse-attendees-in-the-experience">Immerse Attendees in the Experience</h6>
                                    <p>Deliver an experience that makes delegates feel they’re part of something a world away from the humdrum of the 9-5 by immersing them in your theme. Incorporate it into every aspect of your event, from comms to catering, as well as every nook and cranny of your venue – for example, provide opportunities for attendees to create and share social media content, like photobooths or event geofilters.</p>
                                    <h6 id="setting-up-your-venue">Setting Up Your Venue</h6>
                                    <p>Choosing a venue that reflects your brand and helps set the tone for your conference is pretty much “Events 101” – but what does the way you lay out your event say about you?</p>
                                    <p>As an industry we still seem determined to herd delegates around a stage, despite breaking away from having a traditionally rigid divide between audience and speakers. Why not literally set yourself up as innovative, bold and unique by choose a venue with enough space to challenge that conference convention?</p>
                                    <h6 id="festivalisation">Festivalisation</h6>
                                    <p>In short, if your delegates switch off, they won’t hear your message. That’s why today’s conferences borrow heavily from the festival experience, with as much emphasis on entertainment as education.</p>
                                    <p>It’s now not uncommon for live music and stand-up to be booked alongside keynote speeches or to see traditional exhibition stands replaced with tech showcases and interactive experiences.</p>
                                    <p>You may already be following in the footsteps of events like SXSW, by integrating festivalisation into your conference, but, for any occasion, a good rule of thumb is to identify which elements of your event may cause delegates to drift into a daydream.</p>

                                                    <p>While the day of your conference might understandably be the most important date in your calendar, there are still 364 other days (365 in leap years!) you should also be engaging delegates.</p>
                                                    <p>Event communications have a vital role in this engagement and perform many different functions, from simply delivering event details to creating serious hype for the big day. But one of the most underappreciated jobs is reasserting key messaging – before and after your conference.</p>
                                                    <p>The lead up to your conference is the perfect chance to create buzz and capitalise on delegate’s inherent FOMO (fear of missing out) with sneak peaks into your event, a slow drip-feed of details and content from previous years.</p>
                                                    <p>Your messaging should focus on reasons delegates will benefit from attending, instead of aligning directly with your goals.</p>
                                                    <p>In the weeks following your conference you should celebrate the event by sharing plenty of photos and videos, as well as encouraging delegates to do the same – as the experience is fresh in the memory, it’s also the best time to collect feedback. Make sure you check in with your audience, reminding them of why they were there and subtly reasserting key messages.</p>
                                                    <h6 id="the-importance-of-channel-surfing">The Importance of Channel Surfing</h6>
                                                    <p>Any communications professional knows that how you say something is just as important as what you’re saying. Every channel empowers you to talk to delegates differently, so understanding and identifying which are right for your event is vital to your success.</p>
                                                    <p>Is a picture perfect or do you actually need 1000 words? Is sliding into delegates’ DMs a slip up or is their inbox never out of reach? Do they need every little detail or is communication on a need-to-know basis?</p>
                                                    <p>Don’t be afraid to think outside the box in your pursuit of spectacular results. A “public” Facebook Live video can stir up FOMO in even the most anti-social media audience, while a beautifully designed invitation in the post can easily strike a chord with digital natives.</p>
                                                    <p>In general:
                                                    Instagram - Great photo or attractive post with minimal caption. 
                                                    Twitter - Catchy phrase, attention seeking photo.
                                                    FB - brief info, live video, live chat, etc,</p>

                                                    <ul>
                                                    <li>See them speak and have a conversation with them in person before you decide</li>
                                                    <li>Make sure they’re willing to interact with delegates and agree what this involves</li>
                                                    <li>Get a complete breakdown of their fees, and be realistic about any budgetary issues</li>
                                                    <li>Think carefully about booking a speaker whose content might cause division among your audience
                                                    Don’t book anybody who you wouldn’t be happy to choose as the public face of your brand</li>
                                                    </ul>
                                                    <p>Looking internally is a great way to stretch your budget further, retain more control over the speech’s message, and establish your organisation as the home of thought leaders – you may even unearth hidden talent in your ranks.</p>
                                                    <p>This can be an especially effective route to take when your speaker needs to be highly knowledgeable about the intricacies of your industry, understand the nuances of your corporate culture or have a background specific to your organisation.</p>
                                                    <p>It’s also a great opportunity to reward employees with time in the spotlight and integrate delegate-led content into your conference. And if your in-house candidate lacks confidence or public speaking experience, it’s easy to find training.</p>

                                                        <p>The technology uses  in PyCon is as integral to success as the choice of entertainment or communications strategy. Even relatively modern advances like e-ticketing, digital surveys and event apps aren’t just expected by delegates, they’re vital to ensuring an event runs smoothly. However, in this brave new world of conferencing, even providing important functionality soon won’t be enough, as organisers begin to fully understand the significance of delegate engagement.</p>
                                                        <p>For example, once upon a time the majority of delegates were happy carrying around an actual event programme. Yet, as soon as it was possible, they wanted digital versions instead. Now, as well as receiving the information upfront they want to be notified just before a speaker takes to the stage. Giving them enough time to grab a drink and find a spot in the crowd.
                                                        putting a timer on screen before next talk. </p>
                                                        <p>As well as turning a blind eye to any tech that can’t provide what they need when they need it, conference attendees have zero use for anything crowbarred into their experience. VR might still be “on trend”, but if it doesn’t add value to the experience, delegates simply won’t engage with it.</p>

                                                        <p>Many conferences are introducing AI-chatbots to help attendees navigate events without tying up staff, but chatbots also serve another purpose. By simply examining the questions delegates ask, you can learn which elements of your conference are causing confusion.</p>
                                                        <p>Obviously, not everything you learn is going to feel important, but the less time delegates spend worrying about little details, the more attention they can pay to your messaging. </p>
                                                        <p>Although a lot of time and effort is dedicated to arranging the bells and whistles,  your conference is only successful if you actually influence delegates. The key is determining exactly what you want that influence to be and using these trends to make that happen. </p>
