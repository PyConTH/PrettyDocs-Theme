                            <p>As most of the people in a conference organizing committee aren’t being paid, and have
                                busy full-time jobs, it’s important the chair can inspire them from the very top. So,
                                the chair should be able to clearly define goals, and be able to highlight that everyone
                                has a stake in the success of a conference.</p>
                            <p>Planning a conference can make even seasoned events professionals feel jaded or
                                overwhelmed. But to win delegate attention today, you’ve got to do more than just tick
                                off your standard checklist.</p>
                            <p>Successful events leave nothing to chance, and no decision, however small, should be made
                                with consideration. Every aspect of your conference is connected and should be aligned
                                to better delight delegates and satisfy stakeholders.</p>

                            <h5 id="1-understanding-your-goals">1. Understanding Your Goals</h5>
                            <ul>
                                <li>list your goals to keep yourself on track
                                    It is a truth universally acknowledged that no organisation hosts a conference
                                    without a hidden (or sometimes not-so hidden) agenda. Delivering the desired results
                                    is much easier if you understand why vast amounts of time, effort and money are
                                    being invested in the event. In fact, one of the greatest tools for organising a
                                    successful conference is simply having a concrete and quantifiable answer to one
                                    very simple question:</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><em>What does a successful conference look like to you?</em></p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>How Will You Measure Your Success?</li>
                                <li>create KPIs to measure your success</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>When deciding your conference goals, you should also take time to plan how you’ll measure
                                your achievements. Not only will this help you determine if your goals are viable, it’ll
                                also make sure you’re aware of any technology or practices that need to be implemented –
                                for example, a platform to deliver delegate surveys efficiently.</p>
                            <p>Obviously, all conferences are different. While yours might be a tangle of seemingly
                                contradictory goals, you have to decide what is the ultimate aim to go for </p>
                            <p>Identifying the driving force behind your conference and using it to inform your
                                decision-making will significantly simplify the planning process. You can make sure
                                you’re always choosing a route that helps you achieve your goals by just asking
                                yourself:</p>
                            <p>How will this conference element help me achieve this goal?</p>


                            <h5 id="2-understanding-your-target-market">2. Understanding Your Target Market</h5>
                            <p>No matter who’s booked to speak or what entertainment is planned, the real superstars of
                                your conference are your attendees. They’re the beating heart of your event and vital to
                                your success.</p>
                            <p>So, every element of your conference needs to be viewed through the lens of meeting their
                                needs and delivering value (as well as helping you achieve your goals), from the
                                catering and entertainment, to the communications strategy and choice of venue.</p>
                            <p>Of course, delivering this is much easier if you actually know who your delegates are and
                                what they want from a conference. The best way to gain this insight is a tried and
                                tested market research methodology – defining buyer, or in this case attendees,
                                personas.</p>
                            <h4 id="persona-marketing">Persona Marketing</h4>
                            <p>If you’re not already familiar with persona marketing, it involves creating
                                representations of the core delegates that make up your audience, in order to better
                                understand their needs and motivations. This can be done in four basic steps:</p>
                            <p>Segment your audience into typical groups of attendees. These could be based upon
                                anything from location, age, job role, motivation for engagement or any combination that
                                works for your conference.</p>
                            <p>For each segment, collect a set of data that provides a clear idea of the average
                                delegate. You should draw from a wide range of personal, consumer and vocational
                                information – some of which may come from a 3rd-party.</p>
                            <p>Using your data sets, create a well-rounded, semi-fictional character to represent each
                                of your personas. This should make it easier to step into their shoes and see your event
                                through their eyes, providing insight into how you can deliver engaging and delightful
                                conference experiences.</p>
                            <p>When planning your event, always make sure you’re making delegate-centred decisions by
                                constantly asking yourself: How will this conference element provide value for this
                                delegate persona?</p>
                            <p>Your finished delegate personas might read somewhat like the following examples, although
                                you should note that these are very simple and the more detail you include, the more
                                insight you’ll discover. </p>
                            <p>Judging from PyCon Thailand’s delegates, the delegated personas are as below:</p>
                            </br>

                            <p>Employee Emmy is 20-30, engaged and planning to get married soon, works as a backend
                                developer in an international organisation. They&#39;re the household’s secondary earner
                                and their monthly treat is a fancy meal or night out with friends.</p>
                            <p>Emmy takes pride in their job, works hard and embraces any training opportunities
                                available, although they’re generally uninterested in wider company performance. Enjoys
                                having something to aim for and appreciates how their organisation rewards their hard
                                work.</p>

                                offering a more personalised event.</p>
                            <p>Despite your event already being a substantial expense, Paul regularly spends additional
                                money on accessories, add-ons and digital content, as well as making purchases from your
                                partners and sponsors.</p>

                            <p><em>Designing the Delegate Journey</em></p>
                            <p>Every interaction a delegate has that involves your conference should contribute to
                                moving them closer to taking an action needed for you to achieve your goals – from the
                                first point of contact to the very end of the event lifecycle, and every sight, sound
                                and social interaction in-between.</p>
                            <p>Your audience should be able to move seamlessly through the delegate journey and so every
                                touchpoint needs to do three things:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Motivate the delegate to take an action that moves you closer to your goals</li>
                                <li>Provide an obvious way forward along the delegate journey</li>
                                <li>Feel natural and make sense – you should never make delegates feel manipulated</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>When planning you should be able to plot a clear path from the beginning of the delegate
                                journey to the end. If any touchpoints don’t meet the requirements, it’s an opportunity
                                to create new experiences that successfully move delegates along. </p>
                            <p><em>Results</em></p>
                            <p>Creating an enjoyable conference experience is obviously extremely important, but it’s
                                vital you keep in mind that the event is just means to an end – ultimately, success is
                                only judged on whether you achieve your goals.</p>
                            <p>Simply comparing event data to your goals will provide a basic understanding of your
                                achievements. However, this stage of the conference lifecycle is an opportunity to gain
                                in-depth insight into how your event (and you, as a conference organiser) performed.
                                Don’t be scared to dive deeper into your data to find answers.</p>


                            <h5 id="3-managing-your-team">3. Managing your team</h5>
                            <p>As the conference chair, you join an organization and sometimes the organizing committee
                                has already been appointed. So it’s important that you learn how to work with them.</p>
                            <p>Handling a team where everyone has to work alongside the range of expertise and opinions
                                of committee members, it doesn’t always run smoothly…</p>
                            <p>Everything has a knock-on effect when you’re organizing an event. When there isn’t a
                                clear structure in terms of who’s responsible for making what decision, then as an event
                                team we’re not quite sure which direction to go. It all gets a bit messy and delays
                                happen, and then you don’t hit your delegate numbers and conflicts occur too.</p>
                            <p>Go through these train of questions to ask your team member:</p>
                            <p>&quot;What can I do to help you?&quot; </p>
                            <p>&quot;What’s the best way for us to communicate and work with you?&quot; </p>
                            <p>&quot;What do you need from us so you can make the decisions we need you to make?&quot;
                            </p>
                            <p>Providing them with what they need, so they can come back to you with what you need is
                                really important.</p>
                            <p>Getting recognition for your work can be challenging when you’re working with people
                                outside the event planning world who often think organising an event is an easy task. So
                                it’s important that you make them feel confident about your ability to deliver and keep
                                them informed of how things are progressing.
                                Giving committee members a view of the bigger picture is important.</p>
                            <p>As part of the onboarding process, we give them a top-level summary of how the conference
                                fits in strategically with other activities we do. We also include a summary of
                                conference costs and income, to make them aware of financial implications and budgetary
                                restrictions.
                                Then the entire team are clear on where we’re at.</p>
                            <p><em>Avoiding assumptions</em></p>
                            <p>Even if you have to state the obvious, do state it. Because although there are things
                                that for us are standard practice and we think everyone knows this, they don’t. That’s
                                not what they do for a living. So never make assumptions, because sometimes it’s not
                                obvious to them and you realise when it’s too late.“</p>
                            <p>Conduct induction meeting with committee members and follow up with information in
                                writing so they can read it and they can refer back to it. And when we have a
                                conversation with someone over the phone or in person, we follow up with an email to
                                summarise what we discussed so everyone is on the same page.</p>

                            <p>Thankfully, collecting and analysing data no longer requires manually wading through
                                spreadsheets, tally charts, and budgets, so discovering actionable insight into your
                                event now takes far less time and effort.</p>
                            <p>This can give you more time and energy to reflect meaningfully on the results. Your own
                                observations and data complemented with the strategic use of readily available tools
                                will empower you to answer questions like:</p>
                            <p>What messages resonated most?
                                What did we do successfully?
                                What can be improved?</p>
                            <p>Get feedback from your staff, your team, your sponsors.</p>
                            <p>Don’t simply link to your survey in your post-event email. Embed your first question in
                                the survey itself.</p>
                            <p>A SurveyMonkey study found a 22% increase in survey opens when the survey’s first
                                question was right in the email. And not only are people more likely to open a survey
                                that teases the first question, they’re also 20% more likely to finish the entire
                                survey.</p>

                            <p>The final stage of the conference lifecycle brings you full circle, as you begin to set
                                resolutions for next year. Remember, it’s never too early to start doing the necessary
                                groundwork for your next event by thinking about:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Five things we are going to do again and how to improve them</li>
                                <li>Conference elements that actively helped us achieve our goals</li>
                                <li>Five things we are not going to do again and what we can do instead</li>
                                <li>Conference elements that actively prevented us achieving our goals</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h5 id="6-the-handover">6. The Handover</h5>
                            <p>To ensure consistency and that next conference leader has a strong grasp of the
                                organising structure and responsibilities, the conference leader should hold its
                                position for a minimum of 2 years and a maximum of not more than 4 years. Should the
                                conference lead decides to step down in less than 2 years due to unforeseen
                                circumstances, the committee members should submit the names of the candidates before
                                the end of the conference and vote for the next conference lead. </p>
